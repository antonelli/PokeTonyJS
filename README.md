# PokeTonyJS

## Background

Tony is poking me on Facebook, forcing my hand in a poke war I did not want. We are now locked in an arms race.

## How to

Only tested in Chrome, but should work in any browser. 

1) Open up the inspector (right click, choose "Inspect Element" in Chrome).

2) Click "Console"

3) Copy and pase script into the Console

4) Leave window open. 

It will poke back one person per interval  as long as the window is open

## FAQ

### Sure- your script can poke Tony, but what about people with other names?

It will poke not only Tony, but anyone at the top of your poking list. Change the `whoAmIPoking` variable to something more appropriate like "Steve," "John," or try something generic like "Friend."

### Does it scale?

Does it ever! Have a lot of people poking you? Decrease the `howOften` variable to something more frequent. It will poke one person per interval.
